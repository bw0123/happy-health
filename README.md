# Happy health

## Inspiration 
We were curious about the likelihood of seniors experiencing heart-related problems. Therefore, it would be beneficial to allow people to assess their risk.

## Features
* Interactive charts showing what is common for each age or heart rate
* Data input to calculate the odds of having a heart problem 
* Predicts your odds of getting heart disease

## Problem
A problem we had was there wasn't a lot of data on other health problems seniors had.

## Solution
We limited the health problem to heart-related problems for seniors because they have more stable data

## What we learned from this hackathon
Most of the team are new so we learned more about collaborating together.

## Future plan
We plan on adding more health problems that seniors might have. Another idea that can be added if we have more time would be more data.
